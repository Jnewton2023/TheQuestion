The older I get the more I realize that we all know nothing.

I know that i have a loving and supporting family, know how to act like I know what I am doing.

I do not know how to be a web developer (For now)

There is so much information and discoveries that even knowing a lifetime full of things would still 
equate to even 1% of the possibilities of this life.

WE AS HUMANS NO NOTHING!!
