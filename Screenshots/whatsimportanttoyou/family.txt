Family is my number one in life.

Family meaning more than blood, meaning all loved ones that i cherish in 
my everyday that made me into the person i am blessed to be today.

On my time off there is nothing i cherish more than taking time to spend 
with my loved ones. With most of my immediate family being out of state , 
it helps display that family is what makes a home & a home can be anywhere 
that you feel loved.
