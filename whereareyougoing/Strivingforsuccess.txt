Where am i going?

I am aiming to go for happiness. My now goal is to obtain happiness 
however needed. Never wanted to be flashy or wealthy, just wanted a 
genuine life with a happy relationship with mainly myself and the people 
around me. Wanted to obtain a skill to push and invest into myself to aim 
for more independance at work. I have been working very hard and investing 
into companies who treat us less than a statistic. My goal is to take 
some of that success and put it into myself.
