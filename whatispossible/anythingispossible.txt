I believe anything can be possible! 

Anything can be acheived as long as you are willing to work for it. Working for something is what 
can be interpretated as different things. My opinion on working something is to immerse yourself 
fully into the experience. If youre not willing to live and die doing what you love and enjoy than 
truly what are you doing!
